	// StreamDecorator is a way to wrap resource stream into another stream
	// before the associated audio player is created.
	//
	// An example usage for this is to wrap OGG stream into an InfiniteLoop stream.
	// You can use LoopOGG function just for that.
	// Another example could include a preprocessing stream that would
	// alter the original resource sound.
	//
	// Previously, OGG streams were looped by default.
	// This option allows a finer control over what to do with a stream.
	//
	// A nil decorator will use the original stream as is.
	//
	// This function is called exactly once per resource upon its first loading.
	//
	// Note: you can use decorators for any type of audio resource (WAV included),
	// although it's not recommended to do so. By default, this library reads the
	// entire WAV into memory and creates the raw byte stream player from that.
	// Unless you really want to do it, leave this field nil for WAVs.
	// If you want to reduce the application memory footprint, it can be
	// beneficial to add a NopDecorator decorator that would return the input stream as is.
	// This will make WAV more expensive to play in terms of CPU clocks.
